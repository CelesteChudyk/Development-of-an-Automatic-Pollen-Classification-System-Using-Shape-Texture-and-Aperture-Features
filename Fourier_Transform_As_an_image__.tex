Fourier Transform

As an image in input, we make the Fast Fourier Transform of the image given. The next step is to compute the frequency of the transformation. We have a graph of the frequencies now. We take all the 10 best peaks of the graph. We only keep the indexes, and not the values. After this, we compute the difference 2 by 2 (first and second, second and third ...) We have now 9 values, because of the difference of the 10 peaks. We store them, with the mean of the difference, and the variance of the difference.

\subsubsection{Fourier Transform}

Fourier Transforms translate an image from the spatial domain into the frequency domain, and are useful because lower frequencies represent an area of an image with consistent intensity (relatively featureless areas) and higher frequencies represent areas of change \cite{Haas_2011}.  Just as in spatial analysis we cannot compare images directly but first need to extract features, in the frequency domain we likewise extract useful information through analysis of frequency peaks. Here, we apply a Fast Fourier Transform to the image, apply a logarithmic transformation, and create a graph of the resulting frequency domain. After taking the highest 10 frequency peaks, we compute the differences between the peaks and store these values, as well as the mean of the differences and the variance of the differences.

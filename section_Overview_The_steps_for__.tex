\section{Overview} 

The steps for our process are as follows: 1. Image acquisition and particle segmentation, 2. Feature extraction, and 3. Classification.

Our process begins with scanning samples with a digital microscope, then segmenting these images to gather samples of individual pollen particles. These images are then further segmented to identify the pollen boundary, and the area within this boundary is used for feature extraction. 18 shape features, texture features including Fast Fourier Transform, Local Binary Patterns, Historgram of Oriented Gradients, and Haralick features, as well as aperture features are used. These features are then trained using supervised learning to build a model for the 5 pollen species sampled. The model is then tested with ten-folds cross validation. The process is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:process}.

\section{Structure of Program/Software overview} 

The steps for data classification are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Image Acquisition

Five different species have been stained and prepared on glass slides for use with a common digital light-field microscope.  In order to try to mitigate  overfitting, more samples were processed in order to have all species' images come from three distinct sample sets (using a total of 15 samples overall). 

\item Particle Segmentation

Each digital image is processing in order to locate and segment out a confining square surrounding a pollen particle.

\item Blur Filter

Any blurry images, as well as objects fitting outside of the expected boundary sizes for pollen particles, are discarded.

\item Contour Detection

The contour surrounding each pollen particle is identified.

\item Feature Extraction

The contour of the particle is used to calculate shape, texture and aperture features.

\item Classification and validation based on feature set.

\end{enumerate}

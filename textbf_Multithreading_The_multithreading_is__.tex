\section{Multithreading}

The multithreading is a good way to decrease time of execution of a program. Firstable, the program will know the number of cores in your computer, and take the number less 1. It leave 1 for letting free the other tasks.
This previous number will be the number of processing that be executed at the same time. With this number known, it will make first the execution normally. When we give at the program the images, we add all the images to a queue. After, we take the images by the number found. It will locate the alone one too.For example, if we have 4 images, and 4 cores, the program will select the 3 cores, and take at the beginning the 3 first images, and after the last one.
So with this technique, we reduce the time b the number of cores.

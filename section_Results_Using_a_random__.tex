\section{Results}

Using a random forest classifier on a total of 600 samples (120 each for each species) and 252 features, a model was generated with an accuracy of $87\% \pm 2\%$. Considering that the samples were intentionally selected for variability in their appearance and background, this is an indication of a robust, reliable model that shows promise for expansion in the future to also include datasets collected from an outdoor environment. 

The dataset was further modified into different versions in order to test the results using only subsets of the features available.

\begin{table}
    \centering
        \begin{tabular}{ l c }
            \toprule
            Features & Accuracy \\ \midrule
            Shape features & $64\% \pm 3\%$ \\ 
            Shape and Gabor & $76\% \pm 2\%$ \\ 
            Shape and FFT & $65\% \pm 2\%$ \\ 
            Shape and LBP & $65\% \pm 3\%$ \\ 
            Shape and HOG & $67\% \pm 2\%$ \\ 
            Shape and Haralick & $87\% \pm 3\%$ \\ 
            Shape and Aperture & $67\% \pm 2\%$ \\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The above table shows the accuracies of the trained models. Using only the 18 shape features, an accuracy of $64\% \pm 3\%$ was achieved, and adding texture information either through Gabor Filterss or Haralick features substantially improved the results.

\section{Results}

Using a random forest classifier on a total of 600 samples (120 each for each species) and 252 features, a model was generated with an accuracy of $87\% \pm 2\%$. Considering that the samples were intentionally selected for variability in their appearance and background, this is an indication of a robust, reliable model that shows promise for expansion in the future to also include datasets collected from an outdoor environment. 

The dataset was further modified into different versions in order to test the results using only subsets of the features available.

Using the classifier on just the 18 shape features, an accuracy of  $64\% \pm 3\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and Gabor Wavelet features, an accuracy of $76\% \pm 2\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and FFT features, an accuracy of $65\% \pm 2\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and Local Binary Pattern features, an accuracy of $65\% \pm 3\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and Histogram of Oriented Gradient features, an accuracy of $67\% \pm 2\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and Haralick features, an accuracy of $87\% \pm 3\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and aperture features, an accuracy of $67\% \pm 2\%$ was achieved.

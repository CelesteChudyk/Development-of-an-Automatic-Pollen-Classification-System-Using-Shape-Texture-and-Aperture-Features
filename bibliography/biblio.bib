  abstract = {Accurate recognition of airborne pollen taxa is crucial for understanding and treating allergic diseases which affect an important proportion of the world population. Modern computer vision techniques enable the detection of discriminant characteristics. Apertures are among the important characteristics which have not been adequately explored until now. A flexible method of detection, localization, and counting of apertures of different pollen taxa with varying appearances is proposed. Aperture description is based on primitive images following the bag-of-words strategy. A confidence map is estimated based on the classification of sampled regions. The method is designed to be extended modularly to new aperture types employing the same algorithm by building individual classifiers. The method was evaluated on the top five allergenic pollen taxa in Germany, and its robustness to unseen particles was verified.}

  abstract = "The development and testing of two techniques of texture analysis based on different mathematical tools -- the semivariogram and the Fourier spectra -- are presented. These are also compared against a benchmark approach: the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix. The three methods and their implementation are briefly described.   Three series of experiments have been prepared to test the performance of these methods in various classification contexts. These contexts are simulated by varying the   number, type and visual likeness of the texture patches used in classification tests. More specifically, their ability to correctly classify, separate, and associated texture patches is assessed. Results suggest that the classification context has an important impact on performance rates of all methods. The variogram-based and the Gray-Tone Dependency Matrix methods were generally superior, each one in particular contexts."

  abstract = {Gabor filters possess the optimal localization properties in both spatial and frequency domain, and they have been successfully used in many applications. But how to design a set of befitting Gabor filters for a specific application has maybe puzzled many users for a long time. In this paper, we purpose designing a common set of Gabor filters – a Gabor filter family to solve the problem. The Gabor filters in the family are well combined to capture the whole frequency spectrum in all directions. And we can extract many meaningful features using the Gabor filter family. Experimental results in textures and characters demonstrate these features commendably expressing the local informa- tion with the different frequencies and orientations in the image. The Gabor filter family designed by us can be also used in some other applications.}

To support such disciplines computer vision comes to alleviate tedious recognition tasks. In this paper we present an applied study of the state of the art in pattern recognition techniques to describe, analyze, and classify pollen grains in an extensive dataset specifically collected (15 types, 120 samples/type). We also propose a novel contour–inner segmentation of grains, improving 50% of accuracy. In addition to published morphological, statistical, and textural descriptors, we introduce a new descriptor to measure the grain’s contour profile and a logGabor implementation not tested before for this purpose. We found a significant improvement for certain combinations of descriptors, providing an overall accuracy above 99%. Finally, some palynological features that are still difficult to be integrated in computer systems are discussed. "

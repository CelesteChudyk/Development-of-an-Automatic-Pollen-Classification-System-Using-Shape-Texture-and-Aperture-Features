\textbf{Shape features}

We have used 18 shape features already identified to be useful through previous iterations of our research (Lozano). The 18 selected were based on the research of developing an identification process for the Urticaceae family of pollen (Rodriguez-Damian), as well as research into developing universal shape descriptors (Costa).

Shape features used:

\begin{description}
\item[Perimeter ($P$)] Length of contour given by OpenCV's \verb|arcLength()| function
\item[Area ($A$)] Number of pixels contained inside the contour
\item[Roundness ($R$)] $4\pi A \over P^2$
\item[Compactness] $1 \over R$
\item[Thinness/Circularity Ratio ($CR$)] $P-\sqrt{P^2-4\pi A} \over P+\sqrt{P^2-4\pi A}$
\item[Mean Distance ($\bar{S}$)] Average of the distance between the center of gravity and the contour
\item[Minimum Distance ($S_{min}$)] Smallest distance between the center of gravity and the contour
\item[Maximum Distance ($S_{max}$)] Longest distance between the center of gravity and the contour
\item[Ratio1 ($R_1$)] Ratio of maximum distance to minimal distance $S_{max} / S_{min}$
\item[Ratio2 ($R_2$)] Ratio of maximum distance to mean distance $S_{max} / \bar{S}$
\item[Ratio3 ($R_3$)] Ratio of minimum distance to mean distance $S_{min}/ \bar{S}$
\item[Diameter ($D$)] Longest distance between any two points along the contour
\item[Radius Dispersion ($RD$)] Standard deviation of the distances between the center of gravity and the contour
\item[Holes ($H$)] Sum of differences between the Maximal Distance and the distance between center of gravity and the contour
\item[Euclidean Norm ($EN_2$)] Second Euclidean Norm
\item[RMS Mean] RMS mean size
\item[Mean Distance to Boundary] Average distance between every point within the area and the contour
\item[Complexity F] Shape complexity measure based on the ratio of the area and the mean distance to boundary
\end{description}

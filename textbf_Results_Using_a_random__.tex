\section{Results}

Using a random forest classifier on a total of 600 samples (120 each for each species) and 252 features, a model was generated with an accuracy of $87\% \pm 2\%$. This seems at first like a worse result than others previously found in our lab. For instance, a model using only 18 shape features had previously obtained a result of $89\% \pm 3\%$ accuracy. However, this previous dataset had only included samples from one slide per species; in this case it would have been easy for the model to have been overfitted. Including a both a larger and more variable sample space in this case has enhanced the robustness of our current model even if the accuracy has decreased slightly.

The dataset was further modified into different versions in oder to test the results using only subsets of the features available.

Using the classifier on just the 18 shape features, an accuracy of  $64\% \pm 3\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and Gabor Wavelet features, an accuracy of $76\% \pm 2\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and FFT features, an accuracy of $65\% \pm 2\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and Local Binary Pattern features, an accuracy of $65\% \pm 3\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and Histogram of Oriented Gradient features, an accuracy of $67\% \pm 2\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and Haralick features, an accuracy of $87\% \pm 3\%$ was achieved.

Using the shape and aperture features, an accuracy of $67\% \pm 2\%$ was achieved.

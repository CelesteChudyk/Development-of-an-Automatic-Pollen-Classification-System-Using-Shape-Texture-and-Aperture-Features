\subsubsection{Fourier Transform}

We apply a Fast Fourier Transform to the image, apply a logarithmic transformation, and create a graph of the resulting frequency domain. After taking the highest 10 frequency peaks, we compute the differences between the peaks and store these values, as well as the mean of the differences and the variance of the differences.

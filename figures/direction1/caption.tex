\textit{Haralick Features}

Haralick, a professor of the University of New York has realized an algorithm which allow to extract 14 features of an picture : 

\begin{itemize}
\item The angular second moment (ASM) which measure the local homogeneity of the picture.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item The contrast which analyze the image contrast between a pixel and its neighbor
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item The correlation which analyze the linear dependency of grey levels of neighboring pixels.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the variance of the image
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Measure the gray tone variance
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the inverse difference moment : relates inversely to the contrast measure
\end{itemize}

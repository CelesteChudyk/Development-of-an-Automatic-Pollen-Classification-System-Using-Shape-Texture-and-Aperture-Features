\textbf{Structure of Program/Software overview} 

The steps for data classification are as follows:
1. Image Acquisition
Five different species have been stained and prepared on glass slides for use with a common digital light-field microscope.  In order to try to mitigate  overfitting, more samples were processed in order to have all species' images come from three distinct sample sets (using a total of 15 samples overall). 

2. Particle Segmentation
Each digital image is processing in order to locate and segment out a confining square surrounding a pollen particle.

3. Blur Filter
Any blurry images, as well as objects fitting outside of the expected boundary sizes for pollen particles, are discarded.

4. Contour Detection
The contour surrounding each pollen particle is identified.

5. Feature Extraction
The contour of the particle is used to calculate shape, texture and aperture features.

6. These features are used for classification.

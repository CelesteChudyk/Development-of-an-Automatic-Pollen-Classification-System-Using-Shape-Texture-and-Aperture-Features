\section{Image Acquisition and Particle Segmentation}

Five different species (Alder, Birch, Hazel, Mugwort, and Sweet Grass) have been stained and prepared on glass slides for use with a common digital light-field microscope. In order to try to mitigate overfitting, more samples were processed in order to have all speciesâ€™ images come from three distinct sample sets (using a total of 600 sample images obtained from 15 different slides).

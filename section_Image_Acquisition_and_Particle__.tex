\section{Image Acquisition and Particle Segmentation}

Five different species (Alder, Birch, Hazel, Mugwort, and Sweet Grass) have been stained and prepared on glass slides for use with a common digital bright-field microscope. In order to build a robust model, all species had sample images derived from three distinct laboratory slides (using a total of 600 sample images obtained from 15 different slides).
  
This data set is also available for public use at the Data Archiving and Networked Services site (http://dx.doi.org/10.5072/dans-zpr-rjm6).
